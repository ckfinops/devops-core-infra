## Key Features (MVP Coverage)

- **Dashboard Overview:** Real-time metrics, cost trends, anomaly detection, and quick actions.
- **Cost Optimization:** AI-driven recommendations, implementation tracking, ROI, and risk analysis.
- **Multi-Cloud Cost Analysis:** Unified billing, provider comparison, resource tagging, and cross-cloud optimization.
- **Budget Planning & Forecasting:** Predictive analytics, scenario planning, budget alerts, and variance analysis.
- **Cost Alerts & Notifications:** Smart thresholds, custom rules, multi-channel notifications, and alert analytics.
- **Application Inventory:** Asset management, cost allocation, and export capabilities.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Granular permissions, user management, and custom roles.
- **Executive Reporting:** C-level dashboards, custom reports, trend analysis, and export options.
- **Cloud Provider Assets:** AWS, Azure, and GCP asset inventory, with add/view functionality and API integration.
- **User Profile & Preferences:** Editable user profile, Cognito authentication, and DynamoDB sync.
